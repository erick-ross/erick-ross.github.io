# Why should we we do mathematics?

Here is 

Why should 

I have found the following prayer from Johannes Kepler helpful in showing the correct attitude for doing mathematics. There is a lot of pressure in academia today to show off to others how smart you are and how good your research is. Kepler, on the other hand, studied the universe in order to show the Creator's glory, not his own glory. He remembered that any success he had was only possible because of God's grace.  I want this to be my attitude in doing mathematics.
