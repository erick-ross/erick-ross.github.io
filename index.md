# About Me

My name is Erick Ross, and I am currently a Mathematics PhD student studying under [Hui Xue](https://huixue.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University.

I work in analytic number theory. I also have some interests in dynamical systems, and in theoretical computer science. Recently, a lot of my work has involved very explicit computations of various objects relating to modular forms. 

If you want to get in touch, feel free to email me at `erickr AT clemson DOT edu`.
