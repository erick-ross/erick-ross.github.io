## About Me

My name is Erick Ross, and I am currently a Mathematics PhD student studying under [Hui Xue](https://huixue.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University.

I work in Number Theory, specifically studying modular forms.<br>I also have some interests in Dynamical Systems, and in Theoretical Computer Science.

A lot of my work has come from very explicit computations of various objects relating to modular forms. Sometimes, we as mathematicians like to work on very fancy things, only working abstractly. However, one can often gain insight by actually carrying out the messy details to compute specific examples. As a professor once told me, the great mathematicians of old were not afraid to carefully carry out long detailed calculations, and we should not be either. 




I strive to make the following my prayer as I do mathematics.
> I give thanks to Thee, O Lord Creator, Who hast delighted me with Thy makings. In the works of Thy hands have I exulted. Behold! Now, I have employed as much power of mind as Thou didst give me; to the men who are going to read those demonstrations, I have made manifest the glory of Thy works, as much of its infinity as the narrows of my intellect could apprehend.  
> \- Johannes Kepler
