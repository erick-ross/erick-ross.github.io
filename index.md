# About Me

My name is Erick Ross, and I am currently a Mathematics PhD student studying under [Hui Xue](https://huixue.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University.

I work in Number Theory, specifically studying modular forms.<br>I also have some interests in Dynamical Systems, and in Theoretical Computer Science.

A lot of my work has come from very explicit computations of various objects relating to modular forms. Sometimes, we as mathematicians like to work on very fancy things, only working abstractly. However, one can often gain insight by actually carrying out the messy details to compute specific examples. As a professor once told me, the great mathematicians of old were not afraid to carefully carry out long detailed calculations, and we should not be either. 



# Why I do mathematics
I do mathematics primarily to glorify God. 
Mathematics is in some sense the purest form of the pursuit of truth. And this truth exists insofar as it reflects the character of God. As Grothendieck put it, "Mathematical laws may be discovered by man, but they are not created by man, nor even by God. That two plus two equals four is not a decree of God that He is free to change into two plus two equals three, or five. I perceive the mathematical laws as being part of the very nature of God."
Ultimately, the order and structure innate in God's character are precisely the reason why we can even study mathematics in the first place. The universe follows logical principles because it was formed by a Creator who is logical. 

In this sense, I view mathematics as a branch of theology. In studying mathematics, I am studying the natural revelation of God.

This perspective is also extremely humbling. I strive to make the following my prayer as I do mathematics.
> I give thanks to Thee, O Lord Creator, Who hast delighted me with Thy makings. In the works of Thy hands have I exulted. Behold! Now, I have employed as much power of mind as Thou didst give me; to the men who are going to read those demonstrations, I have made manifest the glory of Thy works, as much of its infinity as the narrows of my intellect could apprehend.  
> \- Johannes Kepler

There is a lot of pressure in academia today to show off how smart you are and how successful your research is. Kepler, on the other hand, studied the universe in order to show the Creator's glory, not his own. He remembered that any success he had was only possible because of God's grace. As Paul reminded the church at Corinth, "Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?"
I want this to be my attitude as I do mathematics.
