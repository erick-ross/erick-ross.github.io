## About Me

My name is Erick, and I am currently a Mathematics PhD student studying under [Hui Xue](https://huixue.people.clemson.edu/) at Clemson University.

I work in Number Theory, specifically studying modular forms. A lot of my work comes from very explicit computations of various objects relating to modular forms. As a professor once told me, the great mathematicians of old were not afraid to carry out long tedious calculations, computing lots of examples, and we should not be either. 

I also have some interests in Dynamical Systems, and in Theoretical Computer Science.



This is my prayer as I do mathematics.
> I give thanks to Thee, O Lord Creator, Who hast delighted me with Thy makings. In the works of Thy hands have I exulted. Behold! Now, I have employed as much power of mind as Thou didst give me; to the men who are going to read those demonstrations, I have made manifest the glory of Thy works, as much of its infinity as the narrows of my intellect could apprehend.  
> \- Johannes Kepler
